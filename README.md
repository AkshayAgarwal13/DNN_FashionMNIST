# DNN_FashionMNIST
Neural Network on Fashion MNIST DATA using keras
Problem Statement:

Train a multilayer perceptron (fully connected) on the Fashion MNIST dataset using the
traditional train/test split as given by fashion_mnist.load_data in keras. Use a separate 10000
samples (from the training set) for model selection and to compute learning curves (accuracy
vs epochs, not vs n_samples). Compare a “vanilla” model with a model using drop-out
(potentially a bigger model), and to a model using batch normalization and residual
connections (but not dropout). Visualize learning curves for all models.
